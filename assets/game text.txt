Hi! Welcome to Caption Quest!

I hope you're ready to make your way 
through this immaculately rendered dungeon!

Use keys __ to open locked doors and
avoid red spikeys __ ! Yuck!

And most importantly - don't underestimate 
the power of CONVERSATION! Talk to everyone!

Have fun!



Wagwan LOSER.

That peppy guy in the last room was sending
way too many SCHMUCKS into the dungeon...

...waltzing in here like they own
the place, not even TALKING to me...

...so I've DESTROYED the
bridge over this ravine.

To keep mouthbreathers like YOU out.

Of course, some sort of bug relating to player-npc
interaction could POTENTIALLY be used to help you out...

Of course, some sort of bug relating to not freezing
during player-npc interaction COULD be used to help you...

Although, it seems due to some AWFUL coding you don't freeze
when you talk to NPCs. I suppose that could be useful..

...but perhaps I've said too much.


Thanks for helping me out friend <3
I was stuck there for days -_-

Hmm? You want me to move to the other switch? o_0
Alright...

Unghhh... the vibes over here are rancid :/
I'm going back over there...



Eeeeheheh! Hola, sport!!
Go on and grab that key!

What's that? Why do the red spikes immediately 
kill you even though you have 3 health?

I guess red spikes do 3 damage!
Eeeeheheh!


So you made it!
Prepare to die!
